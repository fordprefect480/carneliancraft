My name is Lara. I’m a 30-something living on the sunny coastline of South Australia with my husband and our two furry friends. I’ve been cross-stitching for six years, but I’ve been crafting all my life. I started designing cross stitch patterns in 2017, and opened my [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/au/shop/laramakesau) store in early 2018. I find inspiration for my patterns in pop culture, nature, and everyday life. When you wander around this website, you’ll find an eclectic selection of tutorials, craft projects, reviews and events. And hopefully a free pattern or two! Thanks for stopping by, and don’t forget to check out Lara Makes on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/laramakes) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/laramakesau).   ![xlara.jpg.pagespeed.ic.B39OtkQ2Sm](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/xlara-pagespeed-ic-b39otkq2sm.jpg) Lara xo
