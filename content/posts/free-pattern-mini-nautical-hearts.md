I love the colours in this one; the navy and red give it a nautical feel. If that doesn’t fit your style, you can give it a unique twist by using any colours of your choice.

This simple pattern will get an experienced stitcher through a quiet afternoon. It uses only full cross stitches, so it's also a great pattern for beginners to perfect the art.

I hope you enjoy this free pattern. Don’t forget to show me your finished piece by tagging [@laramakes](https://www.instagram.com/laramakes/) on Instagram.
