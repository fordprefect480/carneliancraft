**Do you want to learn how to cross stitch? Do you want to learn the skills required to make your own beautiful hand embroidery? Then gather a group of friends together and let me show you how. You supply the venue and the coffee, Iâ€™ll provide everything else.**

Private in-home workshops are now available in the Adelaide metropolitan area. I will come to you to teach you how to cross stitch or embroider. All you need is a table big enough for your group and an iron and ironing board, and I will supply all the materials and tools needed for you to complete your project.

Two workshop options are available: cross stitch and embroidery. Both are suitable for beginners.

## Learn to cross stitch

Each guest will be supplied with a cross stitch kit, including a pattern designed by Lara Makes. I will teach you the basics of cross stitch and help you complete your very own cross stitch.

## Design your own embroidery hoop art

I will teach you at least three basic hand embroidery stitches. You will use these to design your own hoop art, and I will help guide you through the process to completion.

Workshops are suitable for everyone aged 12* and over. Cross stitch and hand embroidery involves using small and sharp needles, scissors, an iron, and focusing your eyes on small objects/areas.

\*I have a current DCSI child-related employment screening. Workshops do not include complete supervision, guardian attendance is required.
