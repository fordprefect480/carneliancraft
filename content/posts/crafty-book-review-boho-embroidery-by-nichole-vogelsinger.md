I don’t know why I didn’t think of this sooner - the local library has a treasure trove of crafty inspiration! 

Last weekend my husband and I went to our local library for the first time since moving into our current neighbourhood (almost a year ago!), mostly just to kill some time on a lazy Sunday. I borrowed three books: one about flower arranging (a great source for pictures, I’ve traced many of the floral images to use for future embroidery projects), one about textile design and the textile manufacturing industry (lots of artistic inspiration and information on using different computer programs to design images and patterns), and one called [Boho Embroidery](http://www.amazon.com/Boho-Embroidery-Projects-Traditional-Stitches/dp/194065520X/ref=s9_simh_gw_g14_i1_r?_encoding=UTF8&fpl=fresh&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=&pf_rd_r=GXHNJM9CPS66F6NNGAN1&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=a6aaf593-1ba4-4f4e-bdcc-0febe090b8ed&pf_rd_i=desktop) by [Nichole Vogelsinger](http://wildboho.com/).

Boho Embroidery is the perfect mix of information and inspiration. I’m not going to tell you everything about the book here, because you need to find yourself a copy and take a look yourself, but I will tell you what I love about it. 

The book is easy to follow and tells you everything you need to make your own boho embroidery. From product recommendations, various materials you can use, to step by step instructions, you'll be able to complete a project of your own from start to finish following this book. 

Beautiful and colourful images can be found on every page of this book which really get your creative juices flowing! Nichole has such a way of combining colour, patterns and textures in unexpected ways. Looking through this book I almost had a new idea every time I turned the page, and it definitely inspired me to step out of my comfort zone when creating art.

Nichole recommends many great products. I'm overly excited to try them all, and my bank account is not happy about it! Living in Adelaide, Australia, I find that we miss out on a lot of the great stitchy and craft products from all over the world, and you'd never know to look for something unless someone tells you about, so this is something I truely appreciate. 

The list of resources is comprehensive without being intimidating. There is enough variety to allow you to create something unique and suited to your style, but not so much that you don't know where to start! The same goes with the instructions and the stitch dictionary too! 

Nichole encourages you to follow your own artistic personality. She has her own style and its evident throughout the book, there are even some templates at the back which you can use in your own projects. But Nichole has also provided many ideas help you to find your own style and to find your own inspiration. Reading the chapter about finding inspiration has made me realise that I am drawn towards art nouveau and art deco designs, and I’m excited to incorporate some of those motifs into my future work. 

After finishing the book I immediately got to work on my own boho embroidery using Nicholes techniques and pattern. I made this mini hoop necklace using some quilting fabric, DMC stranded cotton, and a mini hoop which I had previously bought from \[Forget Me Knots\](http://www.facebook.com/forgetmeknotsnz/) in Christchurch, NZ. It’s not perfect, but I love the colours and I had a lot of fun creating it.

My final message to you today: visit your library for inspiration, get reading, and happy crafting!
