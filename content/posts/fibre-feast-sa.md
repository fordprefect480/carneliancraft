This weekend I attended the very first Fibre Feast in Blackwood, South Australia. Fibre Feast SA is the brainchild of Charmaine of [Yarnarama](http://www.yarnarama.com.au), Jasmin of [Purl and Friends](http://www.facebook.com/PurlandFriends), and Nicole of [Colagirl Collective](http://www.facebook.com/www.colagirl74/). Charmaine told me “Our concept or philosophy for this event was to bring the yarn community together, under one roof and celebrate our love of fibre, yarn, spinning, weaving, crochet, knitting etc.” 27 stall holders packed the hall full of beautifully dyed yarns, cute accessories, and much more. Check out some of the gorgeous yarns by [Squiggle Yarn Co](http://squiggleyarnco.com). Oh my gosh, those colours! ![cof](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_20180324_110832.jpg) A highlight for me was [Vivii](http://www.vivii.com.au), who explained to me the process of turning wool into felt. She let me try on this amazing felt jacket which was completely crafted from one piece of felt. It even had pockets; and not a seam in sight! ![sdr](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_20180324_105754.jpg) I especially loved these gorgeous cushions, also by Vivii. ![cof](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_20180324_105050.jpg) I also met Barb from [Barb's Sew and Knits](http://www.barbssewandknits.com.au/), and saw a knitting machine in action. Very cool! ![cof](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_20180324_112320-1.jpg) And how gorgeous is this shawl, which [Love Bird Lane Yarn](http://www.lovebirdlane.com/) had on display?! ![sdr](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_20180324_111601.jpg) I had no idea we had so many great yarn producers, dyers and retailers here in Adelaide. They hope to start planning the next Fibre Feast soon. To stay up to date you can visit them on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/FibreFeastSA/).
