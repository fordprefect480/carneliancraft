I love flowers. I love the way they can transform a garden, a room, or a mood. Flowers are appropriate for any occasion, and I've been known to buy myself a bunch from time to time. ![xIMG_20180420_091358_562.jpg.pagespeed.ic.bfVwUJ35sY.jpg](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ximg_20180420_091358_562-pagespeed-ic-bfvwuj35sy.jpg?w=972) These cross stitch patterns feature three quotes which show the beauty of flowers. Any of them would make great gifts for mothers day, valentines day, a birthday, or just because. They would also make sweet decorations in a nursery. ![xIMG_20180410_141659-1.jpg.pagespeed.ic.RxM__bDteu](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ximg_20180410_141659-1-pagespeed-ic-rxm__bdteu.jpg) Each pattern can be purchased for AU$3.30 from my [Etsy store](http://www.etsy.com/au/shop/laramakesau), or if you'd like to try them all you can purchase [all three](http://www.etsy.com/au/listing/608916299/set-of-3-floral-cross-stitch-patterns?ref=shop_home_active_1) for the special price of AU$7.92. ![xIMG_20180413_134918-1.jpg.pagespeed.ic.dJKC3lHEsL](https://laramakes.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ximg_20180413_134918-1-pagespeed-ic-djkc3lhesl.jpg) You can find the individual patterns here [You are a Wildflower](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/592772532/you-are-a-wildflower-cross-stitch?ref=related-4) [The Earth Laughs in Flowers](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/595055266/the-earth-laughs-in-flowers-cross-stitch?ref=related-2) [Every Flower Must Grow Through Dirt](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/593489136/cross-stitch-bookmark-pattern-every?ref=shop_home_active_3) I'd love to see what you do with patterns.
