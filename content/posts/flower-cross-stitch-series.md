I love flowers. I love the way they can transform a garden, a room, or a mood. Flowers are appropriate for any occasion, and I've been known to buy myself a bunch from time to time.

These cross stitch patterns feature three quotes which show the beauty of flowers. Any of them would make great gifts for mothers day, valentines day, a birthday, or just because. They would also make sweet decorations in a nursery.
