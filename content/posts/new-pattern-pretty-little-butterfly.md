Last year I visited a butterfly sanctuary in Malaysia. The butterflies there seemed to be attracted to me, and I had several land on me. I was honoured. This cross stitch pattern is gorgeous. It features a cute butterfly with blue floral accents. The pattern comes with a complete alphabet so you can personalise it as you wish.

I think this piece would look so sweet displayed in a hoop and hung on a girl's bedroom door. The pattern is available [in my Etsy store](http://www.etsy.com/au/listing/589811930/pretty-butterfly-cross-stitch-pattern?ref=shop_home_active_1).
